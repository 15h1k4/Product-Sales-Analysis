# Product-Sales-Analysis
HI! My name is Ishika Sarkar. I have created analysis project on Product Sales using MS Excel.
This file consists of Product Sales record of few states in USA.
It has 1000+ sales record along with customer details with their unique Customer ID in sheet "DATA".
The sheet "DATA" has 26 columns including "Total", which I used for the ease of calculations.
Tools Used: Pivot Tables, Text to Columns, Data Validation, Power Pivot, Conditional Formatting and many more tools.
